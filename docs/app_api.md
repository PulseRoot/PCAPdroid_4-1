PCAPdroid exposes an API for other apps to configure and control the packet capture. This can be used to easily enable packet capture in your app, provided that the PCAPdroid app is also installed into the device.

## The API

The [CaptureCtrl.java](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/emanuelef/remote_capture/activities/CaptureCtrl.java) activity is the one exposed to allow you to control the PCAPdroid capture via Intents.

The activity can be easily invoked from the cli by running:

```bash
adb shell am start -e action [ACTION] -e [SETTINGS] -n com.emanuelef.remote_capture/.activities.CaptureCtrl
```

where ACTION is one of:
  - `start`: starts the capture with the specified parameters
  - `stop`: stops the capture
  - `get_status`: get the capture status

The capture parameters are specified via Intent extras, which are discussed below.
A common task is to capture the traffic of a specific app to analyze it into your app. This can be easily accomplished by running PCAPdroid in the
[UDP Exporter mode](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/dump_modes#24-udp-exporter):

```bash
adb shell am start -e action start -e pcap_dump_mode udp_exporter -e collector_ip_address 127.0.0.1 -e collector_port 5123 -e app_filter org.mozilla.firefox -n com.emanuelef.remote_capture/.activities.CaptureCtrl
```

then your app can listen for UDP packets on port `5123` to handle the Firefox network packets.
Another interesting option is to enable the [pcapdroid_trailer](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/advanced_features#45-pcapdroid-trailer) to be able to get the app UID/name into your app.

The Intent above can also be triggered programmatically from your app:

```java
class YourActivity extends Activity {
  private final ActivityResultLauncher<Intent> captureLauncher =
    registerForActivityResult(new StartActivityForResult(), this::handleCaptureResult);

  void startCapture() {
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    intent.setClassName("com.emanuelef.remote_capture", "com.emanuelef.remote_capture.activities.CaptureCtrl");

    intent.putExtra("action", "start");
    intent.putExtra("pcap_dump_mode", "udp_exporter");
    intent.putExtra("collector_ip_address", "127.0.0.1");
    intent.putExtra("collector_port", "5123");
    intent.putExtra("app_filter", "org.mozilla.firefox");

    captureLauncher.launch(intent);
  }

  void handleCaptureResult(final ActivityResult result) {
    if(result.getResultCode() == RESULT_OK) {
      // command executed successfully
    }
  }
}
```

The result code tells if the command succeded or not. Check out the [PCAPReceiver sample app](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPReceiver) for a working example.

## User Consent

To prevent malicious apps from monitoring/hijacking the device traffic, PCAPdroid will ask for user consent every time a capture is started. If the user denies consent, then the request fails. After an app is granted start permission, subsequent requests from that app are automatically granted. 

From the permission dialog the user can choose to permanently grant or deny the capture permission to an app. The permanently granted/denied permissions can be edited from the `Control Permissions` entry in the PCAPdroid settings.

Applications interfacing with PCAPdroid should use the `startActivityForResult` (or the equivalent `ActivityResultLauncher`) when calling its API, rather than `startActivity`. This ensures that the package name of the calling app can be retrieved via [getCallingPackage](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#getCallingPackage()).

## Capture Settings

As shown above, the capture settings can be specified by using intent extras. The updated list of all the supported parameters is available in
[CaptureSettings.java](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/emanuelef/remote_capture/model/CaptureSettings.java).

| Parameter               | Type   | Ver | Mode | Value                                                              |

| pcap_uri                | string |     |      | the URI for the PCAP dump in pcap_file mode                        |
| socks5_enabled          | bool   |     | vpn  | true to redirect the TCP connections to a SOCKS5 proxy             |
| socks5_proxy_ip_address | string |     | vpn  | the IP address of the SOCKS5 proxy                                 |
| socks5_proxy_port       | int    |     | vpn  | the TCP port of the SOCKS5 proxy                                   |

| ip_mode                 | string |  56 | vpn  | which IP addresses to use for the VPN: ipv4 \| ipv6 \| both        |

The `Ver` column indicates the minimum PCAPdroid version required to use the given parameter. The PCAPdroid version can be queried via the `get_status` action as explained below.
The `Mode` column indicates if the option applies to any mode or only to the VPN or root mode.

*NOTE*: for security reasons, since version 1.5.3 you cannot specify a remote server IP address in `collector_ip_address` or in `socks5_proxy_ip_address`. If you really want to do this, you should first set such a remote IP address via the PCAPdroid gui and only then invoke the API.

*NOTE*: due to [file storage restrictions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage), the `pcap_uri` must point to an app internal directory, e.g. `file:///data/user/0/com.emanuelef.remote_capture/cache/dump.pcap`.

## Query the Capture Status

It is possible to check if the capture is currently running by sending an Intent with the `get_status` action. The response Intent contains the following extras:

| Field               | Type   | Value                                                             |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| version_name        | string | the PCAPdroid versionName (e.g. "1.4.5")                          |
| version_code        | int    | the PCAPdroid versionCode, an incremental number for the release  |
| running             | bool   | true if the capture is running                                    |

Other than via the API, the capture may be manually stopped by the user from the PCAPdroid app. In order to be notified when the capture is stopped, you can create a `BroadcastReceiver` and subscribe to the `com.emanuelef.remote_capture.CaptureStatus` action. Here is an example:

```xml
<receiver android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiver"
    android:enabled="true"
    android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.emanuelef.remote_capture.CaptureStatus" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

To tell PCAPdroid to send the Intent to your receiver, you must specify its class name in the `broadcast_receiver` extra of the start intent:

```java
intent.putExtra("action", "start");
intent.putExtra("broadcast_receiver", "com.emanuelef.pcap_receiver.MyBroadcastReceiver");
...
captureStartLauncher.launch(intent);
```

The receiver will get an intent with the `running` extra set to `false` when the capture is stopped.

## Capture Stats

In the result of the `stop` and `get_status` actions and in the broadcast of `CaptureStatus`, PCAPdroid provides the following capture stats in the form of Intent extras:

| Field               | Type   | Ver |  Value                                                             |
|---------------------|--------|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bytes_sent          | long   |  50 | bytes sent (from the device to the Internet)                       |
| bytes_rcvd          | long   |  50 | bytes received (from the Internet to the device)                   |
| bytes_dumped        | long   |  50 | size of the PCAP dump                                              |
| pkts_sent           | int    |  50 | packets sent                                                       |
| pkts_rcvd           | int    |  50 | packets received                                                   |
| pkts_dropped        | int    |  50 | in root mode, number of packets not analyzed and not dumped        |

## Dumping PCAP to file

Due to the restrictions introduced via the [scoped storage](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage), PCAPdroid can only create files inside its private directory, which is not accessible to you as a user. To dump the PCAP file to a publicly available directory, you must first perform the following steps:

1. Open PCAPdroid and select the "PCAP File" dump mode
2. Start the capture and select the path of the file to write. In this example I assume you select the `/sdcard/test.pcap` file
3. Stop the capture and choose to keep the generated PCAP file (don't delete it!)
4. Retrieve the internal URL which Android uses to reference this file. You can find this in the logcat output of PCAPdroid:

```
D/Main: PCAP URI to write [persistable=true]: content://com.android.externalstorage.documents/document/primary%3Atest.pcap
```

You should now be able to write the `test.pcap` file by setting the `pcap_uri` to this URI. You must repeat the steps above if you delete the file.

*NOTE*: if the messages shows `[persistable=false]` then it was not possible to get the permissions on the URI, so the `pcap_uri` paramter won't work. This occurs on devices without a file manager to select the PCAP destination path (e.g. on Android TV).
